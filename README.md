# Introduction

`deedee.elf` is a simple library allowing to parse ELF files.
As my other tools, this one is made to ease the development of POCs.


# Warnings

You can use this one but remember that its primary goal is to store some ugly pieces of code I wrote for my proof of concepts.
Therefore don't expect to see a beautiful code or a pretty architecture.


# Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/d33d33l4bs/proc.git
cd proc
pip install .
```
